# Pokemon cards app

Use the input field to look up pokemons you would like to add to your collection.
You can use both numbers (as pokemon IDs) or names (_names autocomplete is in progress_).

Click 'Add Card' to add it.

Below the input field and add card button you can find filters.
Clicking on them will filter your pokemons to display only the matching type (including pokemons with more than one type).
Only one filter can be active at the time.
To remove filter press X button on the left of the filters.
